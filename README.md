## Abstract
Road traffic accidents are the primary cause of mortality, resulting in the death of around 1.19 million individuals annually. Road crash prediction models are helpful in enhancing urban road safety. Various studies have progressively investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of vehicular crashes and identified hotspots.However, few researchers consider the inherent characteristics of road networks, with most studies focusing solely on the Euclidean metric rather than the city block distance. This study explores the connectedness of roadways and quantifies the spatial and temporal relationships between events using an index derived from the gravity model, weighted by the time delay. Our aim is to develop a predictive model for traffic crashes in New York City, aiding policymakers in understanding the risks associated with demographic and road network effects, facilitating the implementation of targeted improvement policies.
